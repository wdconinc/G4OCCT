March 2021 Update

Added AP242 files for FTC 7, 10, and 11.

AP242 files are now identified by 'ap242-e1' or 'ap242-e2' for the edition 1 or 2 of AP242.
Edition 1 was published in 2014 and edition 2 was published in 2020.  CTC 2 and 3 have AP242
files from both editions.

FTC 8 also has a file 'ap242-e1-tg' where the part geometry uses tessellated (faceted)
surfaces instead of exact geometry.  There is no semantic PMI in this file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The STEP AP203 and AP242 files were generated from the CTC and FTC CAD models used in the 
NIST MBE PMI Validation and Conformance Testing project.  https://go.usa.gov/mGVm

The STEP files were generated by different CAD software and might not represent the current
capabilities of that software.  Information that might show which CAD software generated the
files has been removed.

All of the 'ap203' and 'ap242' files have graphical PMI.  The other STEP files are of only
the part geometry.

Your CAD software or STEP viewer might not support graphical and semantic PMI.  Use the
STEP File Analyzer and Viewer to view the graphical PMI and to analyze the semantic PMI.
The semantic PMI analysis for the AP242 files will be color-coded by the expected PMI.  See
Help > Analyze > NIST CAD Models  https://go.usa.gov/yccx

These are NOT reference STEP files without any errors.  The STEP File Analyzer and Viewer
will report some Syntax Errors.  Other conformance checking software might also indicate
that the files have some errors.  Some of the graphical PMI might not look very good.

To test how well your CAD system implements STEP AP242 PMI, download the NIST PMI CAD models,
open one of the models, export an AP242 file with PMI and process it with the STEP File
Analyzer and Viewer.  The spreadsheet results will indicate how well the AP242 semantic PMI
matches the expected PMI in the test case definition.  Differences might due to how some PMI
was modeled in the CAD system or how the PMI was exported to the STEP file.
